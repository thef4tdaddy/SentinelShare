# SentinelShare

# SentinelShare

**SentinelShare** is an automated financial guardian for your household. It quietly monitors your email inboxes, intelligently detects receipts (from Amazon, recurring subscriptions, etc.), and forwards them to your partner or accountant.

## 💡 The Problem

Keeping family finances in sync is hard. One person buys something on Amazon, but the receipt gets buried in their personal inbox. The other person (or the accountant) has to chase them down for "that $49.99 charge".

## ✅ The Solution

SentinelShare solves this by:

1.  **Watching**: Connecting securely to your Gmail/iCloud.
2.  **Filtering**: Ignoring spam, shipping updates, and promos.
3.  **Forwarding**: Sending _only_ the actual receipts to a designated email.
4.  **Managing**: Providing a unified dashboard to track what's been shared.

It turns a manual chore into a "set it and forget it" background process.

## 🚀 Features

- **🌙 Dark Mode Support**: Sleek, modern interface with automatic system preference detection and manual override (theme persistence).
- **🔐 OAuth2 Authentication**: Secure, modern authentication with Google (Gmail) using OAuth2, eliminating the need for App Passwords. Microsoft (Outlook) support coming soon.
- **📧 In-App Email Management**: Add and manage multiple IMAP accounts directly from the dashboard with encrypted credential storage. Support for both password-based and OAuth2 authentication.
- **Intelligent Forwarding**: Forwards detected receipts to a target email address with a rich, summary header.
- **Smart Actions**:
  - **Block**: Stop forwarding specific senders or categories with one click.
  - **Always Forward**: Whitelist senders to ensure they are never missed.
  - **Settings**: Manage preferences directly from the forwarded email or the dashboard.
- **Modern Web Dashboard**:
  - **Activity Feed**: Real-time log of processed emails.
  - **History**: Searchable history of all actions.
  - **Stats**: Visual breakdown of forwarded vs. blocked emails and spending over time.
  - **Settings**: Configure manual rules, manage blocking lists, and edit email templates.
- **Rich Email Templates**: Customizable, beautiful HTML templates for forwarded emails.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI), SQLModel (SQLite), APScheduler, imaplib.
- **Frontend**: Svelte 5, Tailwind CSS, Vite, Lucide Icons.
- **Deployment**: Ready for Heroku, Docker, or Docker Compose environments (PostgreSQL and SQLite supported).
- **Quality Ensured**: 275+ tests (Pytest, Vitest, Playwright) and robust CI/CD stabilization.

## 📦 Installation & Setup

### 🐳 Docker Quickstart

You can run SentinelShare with a single command using our official Docker image.

```bash
# Pull and run the latest version (GHCR)
# Note: Mount a local data directory to persist receipts and logs
docker run -d \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data \
  --env-file .env \
  --name sentinelshare \
  ghcr.io/thef4tdaddy/sentinelshare:latest
```

Or using `docker-compose.yml` (included in repo):

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Quick Start with Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is with Docker. Choose between SQLite (simpler) or PostgreSQL (production-ready):

**SQLite (Single Container, No Database Setup):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/f4tdaddy/SentinelShare.git
cd SentinelShare
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
docker compose -f docker-compose.sqlite.yml up -d
```

**PostgreSQL (Production-Ready):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/f4tdaddy/SentinelShare.git
cd SentinelShare
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration (including POSTGRES_PASSWORD)
docker compose up -d
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000` and log in with your `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD`.

**👉 See [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md) for detailed Docker setup instructions.**

### Manual Setup

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Node.js 18+
- IMAP-enabled email accounts (Gmail App Passwords recommended)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/f4tdaddy/SentinelShare.git
cd SentinelShare
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create .env file
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials (see Configuration below)
```

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 4. Configuration (.env)

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```ini
# App
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
APP_URL=http://localhost:5173  # Or your production URL

# Authentication
DASHBOARD_PASSWORD=your_secure_password

# Primary Email (Source) - Legacy/Manual IMAP
GMAIL_EMAIL=your_email@gmail.com
GMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password

# Target Email (Recipient)
WIFE_EMAIL=recipient@example.com
SENDER_EMAIL=your_email@gmail.com  # Account to send FROM
SENDER_PASSWORD=your_app_password

# Optional: Additional Accounts (JSON string)
EMAIL_ACCOUNTS='[{"email": "other@icloud.com", "password": "...", "imap_server": "imap.mail.me.com"}]'

# OAuth2 Configuration (Recommended for Gmail)
# Get credentials from Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret

# OAuth2 Configuration for Microsoft (Coming Soon)
MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID=your_microsoft_client_id
MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_microsoft_client_secret
```

#### 🔐 OAuth2 Setup (Recommended)

OAuth2 is the preferred authentication method for Gmail as it's more secure than App Passwords and provides scoped access.

**Google OAuth2 Setup:**

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Gmail API for your project
4. Go to "Credentials" → "Create Credentials" → "OAuth 2.0 Client ID"
5. Choose "Web application" as the application type
6. Add authorized redirect URIs:
   - Development: `http://localhost:8000/api/auth/google/callback`
   - Production: `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/google/callback`
7. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret to your `.env` file
8. In the dashboard, click "Connect with Google" to authorize access

**Microsoft OAuth2 Setup (Coming Soon):**

Microsoft OAuth2 support is planned for future releases. For now, use IMAP with App Passwords for Outlook accounts.

### 5. Running the Application

**Backend:**

```bash
# From root directory
python3 run.py
# Or: uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

**Frontend:**

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` (or your configured port) to access the dashboard.
